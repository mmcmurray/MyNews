The purpose of this file is to present an upgrade path to a user with
an already installed version on MyNews-4. 

1.  In the event of an SQL update (will only happen on major number
    releases), a sql script will be provided to upgrade your
    database.  It is recommended that you back up your data by doing
    a mysql dump in case you need to back out of the upgrade.

    The syntax for a mysql dump is:

    $ mysqldump -opt <dbName> -u <dbUser> -p > <dbName>.dump.sql
      Password: <dbPass>

  * Note:  a major number release for example would be going from
    MyNews-4.2.1 -> MyNews-5.0.1

    In the event a sql upgrade script is not provided, it will be
    noted at the top of this file.

2.  It is recommended (as with upgrading most everything) that you
    backup your files.  This includes modifications to themes you may
    have done, images you may have manipulated and most importantly
    your config.inc.php file.

    In the distributions >= 4.2.1 when copy over your MyNews files,
    your config.inc.php is not overwritten.  A config.inc.php.distro
    file is created in the same directory as the config.inc.php.

    It is recommended you place all of your config values in the
    config.inc.php.distro file, copy your original config.inc.php to
    a safe place and then mv config.inc.php.distro -> config.inc.php

3.  Again, as with any upgrade It is *always* recommended to read the
    Changelog provided with the distribution before you begin your
    upgrade.  There may actually be a change that breaks something you
    have done, and it's nice to know before hand.

4.  Finally, I would like to thank many people for bearing with me on
    the release of MyNews, as there are many things that have been
    broken and in turn fixed.  The list is too long so I'll just say:

    Thank you! (You know who you are ;-)
