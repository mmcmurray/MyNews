/**
 *  1.  GETTING STARTED
 **/
    /**
     *  1.1 - Intro
     **/
    This is MyNews 5.
    
    MyNews is a content management system built on the idea of ease of use.
    It features a module and blocks system as well as a templating engine.
    The template system allows the seperation of code / presentation.  This
    allows the php developers to focus on code and the web developers to
    focus on the presentation.
     
    MyNews only works with MySQL at the moment.  I plan on building in
    database abstraction (most likely with adodb) in the next major release,
    which will be 6.0.  If you want to make it work with other databases,
    please feel free to do so.

    First thing I would like to do, is to give credit where it is due. The
    idea for MyNews wasn't mine.  If it weren't for Stig-Ørjan Smelror of
    winther.net (stig@winther.net) MyNews probably wouldn't have been born.
    Stig wrote the inital release of MyNews and it suited his needs.  I then
    took over the project.  Since the Release of version 2.0, none of Stig's
    code remains, but the concept is still his.  Therefore, I would like to
    thank him again.

    Other people of mention are: JedTheHead from http://www.organization.cx.
    If it weren't for his insight on the comments system, I probably would
    have lost interest a looong time ago.

    Finally, I would like to thank everyone who uses/has used/ and
    contributed to the project.  I'm trying to get things going again, and
    hope that the project takes off after a long vacation.

    Thanks again everyone!

    --Mike

    /**
     *  1.2 - Features
     **/

    Now, on to features, etc...... okay.
    This CMS features the follwing administrative tools: 

        1. Posting/Deleting/Editing content through a web interface.
        2. A nested comment system.
        3. Author administration with Author/Editor/Admin permissions
           (See the README section on PERMISSIONS)
        4. Comment administration.
        5. Submission adminstration.
        6. Calendar administration.

    /**
     *  1.3 - The Administration Interface
     **/

    The admin interface is pretty self explanatory.  I suggest you just play
    around with it to get used to it.

    *NOTE*
    The default login to the admin section is as follows:
    User:   admin
    Pass:   abc123

#--------------------------------------------------------------------#
/**
 *  2.  REQUIREMENTS
 */
 
    Following are packages that are required for MyNews to work.
    The smallest revision number listed is the minimum version of the
    package that is required.  Newer release of the packages are supported
    unless otherwise noted.

    Note: If you want me to test it on a different build, provide me a host ;]

    --------------------------------------------------------
    Package:        Tested Versions:        URL:
    --------------------------------------------------------
    PHP             4.0.6                   (http://www.php.net)
                    4.1.2
                    5.0.4
    MySQL           3.23.35                 (http://www.mysql.com)
                    3.23.43
                    4.1.13
       
#--------------------------------------------------------------------#
/**
 *  3.  INSTALL
 */
    /**
     * 3.1 - Setting Up MySQL
     */

    a)  Connect to your mysql server:
            $ mysql -u <username> -p

        create a database name "mynews".

            mysql> create database mynews;
            mysql> exit;
        
        an alternative way to create the database is to use the
        mysqladmin script. Ex.

            $ mysqladmin -u root -p -create mynews

    b)  Cat the file mynews.sql into your news database.  for ex.

            $ mysql -u <username> -p mynews < mynews.sql

    /**
     *  3.2 - Setting up MyNews
     */

    You will have to setup the config.inc.php file.
    
    It is important to realize that the config.inc.php file needs to be
    located in a specific path or MyNews *will not* work.

    config.inc.php should always be located in the DOCUMENT_ROOT/include/
    directory of your webserver.  If you are not sure where the
    DOCUMENT_ROOT directory is, put the extras/phpinfo.php script in
    somewhere in your web path and look for the DOCUMENT_ROOT variable.
      
        sh$> DOCUMENT_ROOT/include/config.inc.php

    This file is pretty self explanatory, but here's the gist of it.

    *Note* As of MyNews 4.1.2 you will need to copy:

        sh$> DOCUMENT_ROOT/include/config.inc.php.distro
    to:
        sh$> DOCUMENT_ROOT/include/config.inc.php

    /**
     * Note:  In previous versions of the READMe, each config key was
     *        explained.  Most of this documentation already exists
     *        within the config.inc.php file and will no longer
     *        be duplicated within this file.
     */

/**
 *  4.  PERMISSIONS
 */

	There are three levels of permissions for the administration section.  I
	will go over these levels and what permissions they provide.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

#--------------------------------------------------------------------#
/**
 *  5.  SECTIONS
 */

    When a new Section is created It can only be deleted by someone
    with access to the database your MyNews data is stored in.

    There are a couple of reasons I haven't written web base
    administration for this.

    1)  If there are multiple items posted under that Section, what
        section would those items be changed to?

    2)  A section is not truly deleted until all posted News items
        below it are.

    I have left it up to the site administrator to delete sections as
    they feel necessary.  I will provide a couple of example query's on
    how to accomplish this, however.

        mysql>  select * from sections;
            +-------+-------------+-------+
            | secid | section     | front |
            +-------+-------------+-------+
            |     2 | News        |     1 |
            |     4 | Contributed |     0 |
            |     1 | Features    |     0 |
            |     3 | Reviews     |     0 |
            +-------+-------------+-------+
    
    pick the section you want deleted.  Decide if you want to delete all
    items under that section or change those item's section to another.

    To Change to another section.
    * Note: Make sure that <new section> is a section that alreay exists
            in the sections table.  <old section> is the section you want
            to delete.
    
        mysql>  update news set section = '<new section>'
                where section = '<old section>';

    To Delete everything in the section:
    * Note: This is unrecoverable (unless you make frequent backups).

        mysql>  delete from news where section = '<old section>';

#--------------------------------------------------------------------#
/**
 *  6.  THEMES
 */

    * Note: As of release 5 of MyNews, the themeing engine has changed.

    Ahhhh, welcome to the wonderful section on themeing.  Themeing is
    pretty easy as long as you follow a few simple steps.

    1)  The easiest way to learn theming is to hack up an existing one.
        They can be found in:
            {$myNewsConf['path']['sys']['index']}/templates/<theme>/

    2)  The following is a list of files that are required in your
        template:

            layout.tpl      - The main layout of your site.
            box.tpl         - the file that defines how a 'box' looks
            caption.tpl     - same as above but for captions.
            colors.tpl      - defines some default site colors that
                              aren't defined via CSS

    3)  You will *always* need the following files located in:
            {$myNewsConf['path']['sys']['index']}/templates/

            system_header.php       - contains any pre-output definitions
                                      or code you want to be global.
            system_footer.php       - contains any post-output definitions
                                      or code you want to be global.
            template.functions.php  - a library of functions that pertain
                                      to the layout of the site.

    Again, themeing is not *that* hard, but it does take a little practice
    and an understanding of php.

    If you build a theme send an email to me (See CONTACT) with the theme
    tar.gz'd and I'll put a link to it from the MyNews homepage.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------#
/**
 *  7.  CHANNEL FILE
 */

    If the ['default']['channel'] config key is turned on, MyNews will
    write an RSS* file with the headlines from your 10 newest News Items.

    This ['default']['channel_file'] config key is necessary if you set
    ['default']['channel'] to 'on'.

    This will create a file in your MyNews installation directory by the
    name of whatever you set the ['default']['channel_file'] key to.

    There are a few different ways to accomplish getting the Channel File
    setup.


    1)  You create an empty file with the correct owner/permissions before
        turning the key on.

            $ touch /path/to/mynews/install/htdocs/channel.rdf
            $ chgrp nobody /path/to/mynews/install/htdocs/channel.rdf
            $ chmod 664 /path/to/mynews/install/htdocs/channel.rdf

        This *is* recommended.

    2)  You create the file, and set it to writable by anyone.

            $ touch /path/to/mynews/install/htdocs/channel.rdf
            $ chmod 666 /path/to/mynews/install/htdocs/channel.rdf

        This is *not* recommended.
    
    3)  Your MyNews install directory will either need to be mode 0777 (as the
        file is written to/read from as the user your webserver runs as.

            $ chmod 777 /path/to/mynews/install/htdocs
    
        This is *not* recommended.

      * RSS stands for Rich Site Summary and can be read about at:
        http://www.webreview.com/1999/10_29/webauthors/10_29_99_2a.shtml

#--------------------------------------------------------------------#
/**
 *  8.  MISC
 */

    * Note: The about link always refers to the first article in your
            database.  It is recommended to set your first article as
            inactive, and populated with your "about" content.
