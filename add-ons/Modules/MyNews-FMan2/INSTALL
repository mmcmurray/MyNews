INSTALL:    MyNews-FMan2

/*******************************************************************/

NOTE: Before installing this package, pleaes view the README file
      in it's entirety.

NOTE: If you are upgrading a previously install version, please see
      the UPGRADING file for detailed upgrading instructions.

NOTE: Welcome back from the README!

1)  Make sure you're in the MyNews-FMan2 root directory.

2)  Insert the "help" data into your current MyNews database.

    $ mysql -u <user> -p <database> < sql/MyNews-FMan2.help.sql
    Password: ********

3)  Changed to the MyNews-FMan2/htdocs directory

    $ cd htdocs/

4)  Recursively copy all of the files into your MyNews Installation
    htdocs directory.

    $ cp -Rv * /path/to/MyNews-5/htdocs/.

5)  You shouldn't need to change configuration parameters, but if you
    would like to view what they are, they are stored in the 
    modules/conf/ directory.

    $ vim /path/to/MyNews-5/htdocs/modules/conf/fman2.conf.php

6)  You will need to create your userdata repository.

    $ cd /path/to/MyNews-5/htdocs/modules/
    $ mkdir userdata

7)  Change permissions on the userdata to allow FMan2 to write to it.

    This can either be accomplished by setting the directory
    read/write/execute for all users.  This is not the recommended
    method, but works none-the-less.

    $ chmod 777 userdata

    The recommended method, if you have superuser (root) access, is
    change the ownership on the userdata directory to your webserver
    user (most likely, either the nobody user or the www user.

    $ su
    $ chown <webserver_user> userdata
    $ exit

8)  Now you need to insert MyNews-FMan module into the MyNews
    installation.  This is accomplished by including the module
    config file into the main config file.

    - While still in the /path/to/MyNews-5/htdocs directory:

        $ vi include/config.inc.php

    - Insert the following line at the bottom of the MyNews config
      file.  (Before the "?>".)
        
    include(MODULE_ROOT . '/conf/fman2.conf.php');

9)  Congratulations!  You should now see a link in your MyNews Admin
    interface (via webbrowser) to the "Module: File Manager II" page.
