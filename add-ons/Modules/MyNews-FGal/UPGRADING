UPGRADING:  MyNews-FGal

/*******************************************************************/

For users of the old MyNews-4 "photo gallery" module, this file
provides the necessary steps to upgrade that database to a
MyNews-5 install of this MyNews-FGal addon module.

** Note: Please make sure the MyNews-FGal installation instructions
         are followed before using this upgrade tutorial.

1)  First thing, you will need to copy your current images from their
    present location to the following directory.

    $ /path/to/MyNews5/htdocs/modules/userdata/<username>/fgal/

2)  All sub-directories below the `userdata` directory will need to
    be owned by the webserver user[1] or world read/write/executable.

    [1] Most often either `nobody` or `www`

    $ cd /path/to/MyNews5/htdocs/modules/
    $ chown -R 777 *

    or the preferred method.

    $ cd /path/to/MyNews5/htdocs/modules/
    $ su
    Password: ********
    $ chown -R <web_user> *

3)  Now that these files are here, you will need to remove all of the
    old thumbnails.

    ** Note:  Upon initial load, new thumbnails will be generated.

    $ cd /path/to/MyNews5/htdocs/modules/userdata/<user>/fgal/
    $ rm -rf thumbnails

4)  Next up, we need to copy the old photos database from the
    MyNews-4 installation and insert it into the new MyNews-5
    database.

    $ cd /path/to/MyNews5/sql
    $ mysqldump -u <user> -p <MyNews-4 DB> photos > photos.sql

5)  Insert these into your new MyNews-5 Database.

    $ mysql -u <user> -p <MyNews-5 DB> < photos.sql

6)  Now we need to run the SQL upgrade script against the photos
    table in the MyNews-5 database.

    $ mysql -u <user> -p <MyNews-5 DB> < MyNews-FGal-upgrade.sql

7)  Congratulations, this should complete the upgrade process from
    the old MyNews-4 photo gallery module to the new MyNews-5
    FGal module.
