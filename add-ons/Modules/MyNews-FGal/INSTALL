/*******************************************************************/
** NOTE: Before installing this package, pleaes view the README file
      in it's entirety.

** NOTE: If you are upgrading a previously installed version, please
      see the UPGRADING file for detailed upgrading instructions.
/*******************************************************************/
1)  Make sure you're in the MyNews-FGal root directory.

2)  Insert the FGal db tables into your MyNews-5 database.

    ** Note:  If upgrading from a MyNews-4 Photo Gallery, please skip
              this step and proceed to step 3.

    $ mysql -u <user> -p <database> < sql/MyNews-FGal.sql
    Password: ********

3)  Changed to the MyNews-FGal/htdocs directory

    $ cd htdocs/

4)  Recursively copy all of the files into your MyNews Installation
    htdocs directory.

    $ cp -Rv * /path/to/MyNews-5/htdocs/.

5)  You shouldn't need to change configuration parameters, but if you
    would like to view what they are, they are stored in the 
    modules/conf/ directory.

    $ vim <MyNewsRoot>/htdocs/modules/conf/fgal.conf.php

6)  Now you need to insert MyNews-FGal module into the MyNews-5
    installation.  This is accomplished by including the module
    config file into the main config file.

    - While still in the <MyNewsRoot>/htdocs directory:

        $ vi include/config.inc.php

    - Insert the following line at the bottom of the MyNews config
      file.  (Before the "?>".)
        
    include(MODULE_ROOT . '/conf/fgal.conf.php');

7)  Congratulations!  You should now see a link in your MyNews Admin
    interface (via webbrowser) to the "Module: Foto Gallery" page.
